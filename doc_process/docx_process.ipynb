      "Combat FAQ\n",
      "Last Updated: 83d\n",
      "1. Formation\n",
      "- Infantry, as primary damage takers, are positioned in the front row.\n",
      "- Lancers, as mobile units, are positioned in the middle row.\n",
      "- Marksmen, providing the highest single-target damage, are positioned in the back row.\n",
      "2. Process\n",
      "- Expedition battles are turn-based. Once initiated, each turn sees both sides selecting targets and attacking simultaneously. After all units have completed their actions and damage is tallied, the next turn begins.\n",
      "- The battle ends when all troops of one side are defeated, declaring the other side the winner.\n",
      "3. Target Selection\n",
      "- Normally, units attack the enemy's front row first. When the front row is eliminated, they target the next row.\n",
      "- Lancers sometimes activate skills to directly attack enemy Marksmen in the back row.\n",
      "- Some hero skills can target all units or specific unit types.\n",
      "4. Outcome\n",
      "- Different types of battles have varying casualty rates. After each battle, the number of dead, severely injured, lightly injured, and survivors is calculated based on the type of battle.\n",
      "- For example, in player City battles, 35% of the attacker's casualties die; in Sunfire Castle battles, all casualties go to the Infirmary until it's full, and then any further casualties die.\n",
      "5. Hero Skills\n",
      "- If a squad includes a hero, their expedition skills are activated (some skills are probability-based), regardless of whether the squad has the matching type of troops.\n",
      "- Hero skills function independently of the stats listed in the battle report.\n",
      "6. Rally & Garrison\n",
      "- Rally battles differ from solo battles mainly in the number of troops involved and skills activated. Besides the 9 hero skills of the rally initiator, 4 primary hero skills (First skill of each hero) of rally members are also included.\n",
      "- In garrison battles, the player with the highest stat bonuses is chosen as the source of defense bonuses. Additionally, 4 primary hero skills from other garrison members are activated for the battle.\n",
      "7. Pre-Battle Strategy\n",
      "- Troop composition: You can choose different ratios of unit types to ensure enough Infantry to absorb damage, allowing units in the back row more room to deal damage and increasing your chances of victory.\n",
